            A word's meaning can differ greatly between people, times, places, etc. Many of the words used to describe significant values throughout American history, both praised and contested, have remained consistent, while their meanings have evolved. Using article data from the New York Times from as far back as 1851, we present data visualizations that depict what two of these protean words once represented and what they stand for today.
