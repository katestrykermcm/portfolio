                        On May 9, 1865, the Confederates surrendered to the Union army, ending the American Civil War. Shortly after began the Reconstruction years, where many southern Republicans wanted to maintain their wartime agenda and support of protective tariffs, pro-business national banking system, liberal land policies for settlers, and federal aid for railroad development. This group called themselves Radical Republicans.

                        Eugene Victor Debs was one of the most noteworthy American union leaders. In 1894, he called a boycotts of the American Railway Union against handling trains with Pullman cars, in what became the nationwide Pullman Strike. He considered himself a radical socialist, and was a founding member of the Social Democratic Party of America.

                        In August 1919, J. Edgar Hoover became the head of the Bureau of Investigation’s Radical Division, with the goal to monitor and disrupt the work of domestic radicals. By 1920, the Palmer Raids were initiated due to the Red Scare across the country. The raids were carried out with the intent to punish, arrest, or deport any radical whose politics were deemed dangerous by the U.S.

                        1967 through the end of 1968 is often considered the most unforgettable time periods in U.S. history. The New Left that emerged in the 1960’s consisted of many agitators or radicals who sought to implement reforms on civil rights, gay rights, abortion, gender roles, drugs, and anti-war. These reform movements came to a collision in 1968 with the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy.

                        In a 1970 essay for New York magazine, Tom Wolfe coined the phrase “radical chic.” The term was used to describe the adoption and promotion of radical political causes by celebrities, socialites, and high society. In contrast to dedicated activists, Wolfe believed that those who engaged in “radical chic” were frivolous and were only invested in how their actions improved their public image.

                        The “War on Terror” began following the 9/11 attacks and Osama bin Laden’s ties to al-Qaeda and adherence to militant Islam. However, the term’s association with violence dates back to 1979, when the Associated Press reported on the assassinations of two of Ayatollah Khomeini’s supporters as being a part of the “radical Islamic” group. Today, the term is highly contested. President Donald Trump criticized Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for not referencing “radical Islam” when discussing the Paris attacks, San Bernardino shooting, and Pulse Night Club shooting.
