          <p class="leadpara">Yet again, for New York's moderates and liberals, the political lesson should be obvious. Together, they continue to hold the balance of power in the state, even when some hostile winds are howling from across the Hudson. But when they sponsor rival candidates in a general election against conservatives, they split the vote and get blown away. There is no need to torture the numbers to prove the point; the might-have-beens in any election are not always demonstrable with arithmetic. But when third-party candidates like John Anderson and Jacob Javits gather even a modest 7 and 11 percent of the vote on a Liberal Party line, they obviously facilitate the election of candidates who stand far to the right of them and the electorate. Thus aided, Ronald Reagan took New York from Jimmy Carter by 3 points, 47-44. Even more clearly aided, Alfonse D'Amato defeated Elizabeth Holtzman for the Senate seat by a mere one percentage point, 45-44.</p>
