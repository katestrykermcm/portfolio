                        The word “progressive” garnered the country’s attention in 1912, when Theodore Roosevelt ran on the Progressive Party for the presidential election. Although he was defeated by Woodrow Wilson, the party’s ideologies were adopted by many Americans in the height of the Progressive Era. In 1913, the Federal Reserve System was created, a Progressive economic policy push. However, by 1914, the Progressive Party began to crumble. Roosevelt eventually left the party and ran as a Democrat in the 1916 election.

                        The United States entered World War I in 1918. The new Progressive movement was split by those in favor of the war and those against. Public opinion favored the war efforts, but many famous Progressive reformers began to protest the U.S.’s involvement.

                        <div class="title">The Great Depression<br>1928-1929</div>
                        Great Depression led to the creation of a new progressive, the “liberal.” It suggested a growing respect for civil liberties, rejecting the former progressives’ tendency to favor social control over individual freedom. As reformers became “liberals,” “progressives” became more radical.

                        In 1948, Henry Wallace emerges and runs for president as the candidate of a revived Progressive Party, on a platform of labor rights and friendly overtures to the Soviet Union. He ran as a radical socialist with progressive policies focused around labor rights. However, after a massive defeat, his campaign stained the term “progressive” for many years following.

                        In 1960, John F. Kennedy became the new face of the “New Left” and the Democrat party. The emergence of the “New Left,” didn’t want to be associated with the negative connotations of the term “progressive,” and tried to adopt, “radical,” or “revolutionary” or even “anti-communist” to draw a contrast with Cold War Liberals.

                        This time period is known as the “Reagan Revoltion” and the rise of the modern conservatism movement. The movement began to attack “liberals” as self-interested, pedantic advocates of “big government,” while the new Reagan administration pushed for supply-side economics and tax cuts.

                        The term “progressive” rose again in the 2015 presidential election as Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders ran for the Democratic candidate as a “Progressive Socialist.” His ideologies and policies resonated with a younger voting population. His proponents also began to criticize Hillary Clinton for trying to add the “Progressive” label to her campaign. Many claimed she didn’t know what progressive stood for, and that her party was not associated with the ideologies and policies.
