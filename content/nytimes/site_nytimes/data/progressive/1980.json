His concert Friday is almost sure to be direct and honest in a manner that will give most members of the audience a taste of ''timelessness.''

''I shook hands with Piney Brown, and I just couldn't keep from crying.'' Unless one is a jazz historian, one doesn't know at this point who Piney Brown was (he was a black bartender who lent money to many jazz musicians), but one doesn't have to know to feel the mixture of poignancy and pride Mr. Turner is expressing. The Kansas City the singer remembers was a thriving Depression era metropolis where an entrenched political machine allowed bars, gambling dens, and bordellos to operate around the clock, thus providing work for hundreds of jazz musicians. As the film soon makes clear, with shots of boarded-up storefronts, pawn shops, and vacant lots near today's 18th and Vine, that Kansas City no longer exists; thus the poignancy. But there's ample reason for Mr. Turner's pride. Together with musicians like Lester Young, Charlie Parker, Count Basie and Jay McShann, he helped create some of the finest and most innovative jazz and blues America has produced.","page":"20","artlID":"4fd109b18eb7c8105d5bc931","words":1338,"abstract":null,"date":"1980-06-15T00:00:00Z","keywords":[],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"A Film Tribute To 1930's Jazz In Kansas City; A Film Tribute to Kansas City Jazz","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9906E6D91E3EE732A25756C1A9609C94619FD6CF","leadPara":"\"I dreamed I went back to Kansas City and stood on 18th and Vine,\" sings Big Joe Turner near the beginning of Bruce Ricker's film about Kansas City jazz, \"The Last of the Blue Devils,\" which has its ...","page":"D20","artlID":"4fc49a2f45c1498b0da86929","words":1413,"abstract":"Robert Palmer discusses Bruce Ricker's film about Kansas City jazz, 'The Last of the Blue Devils' (M)","date":"1980-06-15T00:00:00Z","keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"LAST OF THE BLUE DEVILS, THE"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOTION PICTURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS AND OTHER DATA ON SPECIFIC PRODUCTIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"}],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"The Aid for El Salvador Is Called Nonlethal","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9900EED91E3EE732A25756C1A9609C94619FD6CF","leadPara":"PHILADELPHIA--Carter Administration officials, when pressing Congress for passage of $5.7 million in emergency military assistance for El Salvador on March 25, insisted that the ...","page":"E21","artlID":"4fc4a6ef45c1498b0dabe7b3","words":908,"abstract":"Thomas Conrad-Cynthia Arnson article scores America's 'nonlethal' military aid for military-civilian junta (M)","date":"1980-06-15T00:00:00Z","keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"SALVADOR, EL"}],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"THE AID FOR EL SALVADOR IS CALLED NONLETHAL","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=950CE2DE1239F936A25755C0A966948260","leadPara":"Carter Administration officials, when pressing Congress for passage of $5.7 million in emergency military assistance for El Salvador on March 25, insisted that the request was for ''nonlethal'' equipment that ''will help strengthen the Army's key role in reforms.'' The package was approved a week later. According to Congressional testimony on March 25 by Franklin D. Kramer, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, the aid would consist of $3.7 million for trucks and transport vehicles, $316,000 for riot-control gear, $1.2 million for communications equipment, and $400,000 for ''various other equipment to include trailers.'' The rest of the outlay was for transporting the materiel. What Mr. Kramer neglected to disclose in his public testimony was that the aid package in fact included combat-related equipment that stretches the definition of ''nonlethal'' beyond credibility. The Defense Security Assistance Agency had provided Congress with a list of the items in the military-aid proposal that was more detailed than the one made public by Mr. Kramer. The members of Congress who saw the list - it was given to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee - accepted the ''nonlethal'' designation despite the nature of the equipment. When this gear reaches the field, however, any distinction between lethal and nonlethal will have been lost. As repression by Salvadoran security forces escalates daily in the countryside, this gear becomes vital to the junta's waging of counterinsurgency war. Under the Freedom of Information Act, the American Friends Service Committee has obtained copies of the ''Letters of Offer and Acceptance'' from the Department of the Army that detail the military aid approved by Congress. To be delivered (some equipment is en route, the Army says) are 7,500 CS tear-gas grenades, 250 ''Manpack'' field combat radios, thousands of batteries, and an unspecified number of tear-gas-grenade launchers. The sale of 50 portable PVS-2B night-vision devices blurs the supposed distinction between lethal and nonlethal weapons: These electro-optic devices are used for observation and nighttime weapons targeting. Night-vision-weapons technology and related equipment like the 12 ''Image Intensifiers,'' also included, were perfected for use in Vietnam. To help security forces preserve so-called law and order, the Administration is sending three communications-monitoring sets at more than $38,000 each. An Army aide says that security forces will use them to monitor the airwaves and track the exact locations of clandestine-radio transmitters: ''It's perfect for use against guerrillas and insurgents.''","page":"21","artlID":"4fd10f188eb7c8105d5c327b","words":893,"abstract":null,"date":"1980-06-15T00:00:00Z","keywords":[],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"POR WAY TO PICK A PRESIDENT","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C05EFDC1239F935A25755C0A966948260","leadPara":"To the Editor: For years, I have admired the system with which we elect our Presidents.

The result has been a music that is strange and still primitive, and it has had a profound impact on new-wave rock. Third World, headliner at concerts Thursday at the Beacon Theater and Saturday at Brooklyn College, purveys a different kind of reggae progressivism, and it made a striking contrast with the other reggae act on the bill, Toots and the Maytals.

But Friday looked like old-fashioned rock-star hero worship all over again. The League of Gentlemen seems an unabashed showcase for Mr. Fripp. Every time he grimaced, people would raise their fists in the air and howl.

A spokesman for the agency said the pilot of one of the planes, a Cessna twin-engine craft, had told controllers that the other plane, a twin Piper, had gone by at the same altitude.","page":"3","artlID":"4fd1149d8eb7c8105d5ca463","words":351,"abstract":null,"date":"1980-07-08T00:00:00Z","keywords":[],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"At the Movies","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9500E7D71338E432A25752C1A9619C94619FD6CF","leadPara":"HAVING played opposite a gorilla in her first film, the remake of \"King Kong,\" and the angel of death in her second, \"All That Jazz,\" Jessica Lange is glad to have a chance to be a person instead of a presence in her third and fourth films.","page":"C6","artlID":"4fc4a45b45c1498b0dab33c3","words":1047,"abstract":"How to Beat the High Cost of Living (Movie): Jessica Lange, who appears in film, interviewed; portrait (S)","date":"1980-07-11T00:00:00Z","keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"HOW TO BEAT THE HIGH COST OF LIVING"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOTION PICTURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS AND OTHER DATA ON SPECIFIC PRODUCTIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOTION PICTURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS AND OTHER DATA ON SPECIFIC PRODUCTIONS"}],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"Pontiff Cautions Brazil's Bishops To Stress Gospel; Evangelizing Is Stressed Pope Tells Brazil's Bishops Not to Neglect Gospel Catechism Is Called Urgent Church Under Fire Political Partisanship Shunned","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E02E2D81338E432A25752C1A9619C94619FD6CF","leadPara":"FORTALEZA, Brazil, July 10--Pope John Paul II told a gathering of the bishops of Brazil today that in their zeal for promoting social progress they were neglecting the need to spread the Gospel.","page":"A1","artlID":"4fc4a39845c1498b0daaffde","words":723,"abstract":"Pope tells gathering of bishops of Brazil that in their zeal for promoting social progress they are neglecting need to spread Gospel (S)","date":"1980-07-11T00:00:00Z","keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"POPE"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH"}],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"Jessica Lange since 'Kong' and 'Jazz.'","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0CE5DC1F39F932A25754C0A966948260","leadPara":"HAVING played opposite a gorilla in her first film, the remake of ''King Kong,'' and the angel of death in her second, ''All That Jazz,'' Jessica Lange is glad to have a chance to be a person instead of a presence in her third and fourth films.

The label may have been useful at one time, but it was never really adequate; now it's utterly irrelevant. Mr. Loggins's band includes musicians who play English horn, bass clarinet, flutes and various saxophones, and several of his arrangements call for thick synthesizer textures. Firefall's music ranges from lightly country-flavored numbers to moderately convincing hard rock to the sort of disciplined harmony singing pop groups like the Association used to purvey. This stuff isn't ''country-rock,'' it's today's mainstream popular music. Mr. Loggins, who used to be half of the Loggins-Messina duo and has gone on to continuing commercial success as a solo artist, has always been a little too breathy, a little too sweet for this listener. But there's no denying that he has tackled a broad range of pop styles, from country to rockabilly to blue-eyed soul to something approximating English progressive rock, and presumably he hass broadened his audience's tastes in the process. He's too concerned with his selling points to abandon the informal, just-me-and-you-all solo interludes that have always figured in his presentations; these interludes present him at his breathiest, sweetest and most vulnerable, and his fans love them. But with each album and each tour he hass ventured into additional musical idioms, and while to these ears he's not particularly convincing when he's singing material influenced by soul or hard rock, at least he isn't standing still.","page":"19","artlID":"4fd113c78eb7c8105d5c9d4f","words":345,"abstract":null,"date":"1980-07-31T00:00:00Z","keywords":[],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"No Headline","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9805E4DB1539F932A3575BC0A966948260","leadPara":"CAMPAIGN REPORT; Reagan Agrees to Debate Kennedy if He Is Nominated","page":"8","artlID":"4fd1153c8eb7c8105d5cb55f","words":364,"abstract":null,"date":"1980-08-01T00:00:00Z","keywords":[],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"Campaign Report; Reagan Agrees to Debate Kennedy if He Is Nominated Democrats, Independents Join a Reagan Fund Drive Commoner Seeks Support Of Kennedy Delegates","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9900E7DB133BE732A25752C0A96E9C94619FD6CF","leadPara":null,"page":"A8","artlID":"4fc4a81e45c1498b0dac404b","words":365,"abstract":"Ronald Reagan says that if Sen Kennedy wins Democratic Presidential nomination he will debate him; says he will also debate Repr Anderson, if Anderson proves to be viable candidate (S)","date":"1980-08-01T00:00:00Z","keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"REPUBLICAN PARTY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"CITIZENS PARTY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"DEMOCRATIC PARTY"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1980"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES AND POST-CONVENTION CAMPAIGN"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1980"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES AND POST-CONVENTION CAMPAIGN"},{"name":"subject","value":"THIRD-PARTY MOVES"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1980"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRANTS AND PRE-CONVENTION CAMPAIGN"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1980"},{"name":"subject","value":"ISSUES AND PLATFORMS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CAMPAIGN DEBATES"}],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"OBSERVER Overload On the Front End","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9802E7D61038E732A25751C0A96E9C94619FD6CF","leadPara":"Though my grasp of politics is uncertain, to say the best, it looks to me like the Democrats have reformed themselves right into a pickle.","page":"21","artlID":"4fc4a46045c1498b0dab387b","words":773,"abstract":"Russell Baker says Democratic Party reforms which bind delegates to decisions made up to 10 months in advance of convention fail to consider short length of the American attention span (M)","date":"1980-08-02T00:00:00Z","keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"DEMOCRATIC PARTY"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1980"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRANTS AND PRE-CONVENTION CAMPAIGN"}],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"A BOOMING ALBERTA BOILS ON OIL PRICES","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C0DEEDA1539F931A3575BC0A966948260","leadPara":"There appears to be a building crane on every downtown street of Alberta's two main cities, Edmonton, the capital, and Calgary, the center of the fast-growing oil and gas industry.

By Michael B. Stoff. 249 pp. New Haven: Yale University Press. $15. ACCESS to crude oil and security of supply are not new concerns, but they were not particularly visible issues in the United States during the 1950's and 1960's because the system that emerged after World War II was working quite well. The combination of public and private interests assured the flow of oil and kept political encroachment at bay. An important part of the answer to the puzzling problem of how this postwar system led the Western nations to become overdependent on Middle Eastern oil is provided in ''Oil, War, and American Security'' by Michael Stoff, an assistant professor of history at the University of Texas. The book concerns the interaction of the United States Government and the American oil companies during World War II and the postwar expansion of American influence in the Middle East. The central role of oil became apparent to American leaders when the war created enormous energy demands that were met out of American reserves. (The Allied military effort used seven billion barrels, six billion of which came from American wells.) Three important policy concerns emerged during the war and the immediate postwar period. The first was howto conserve United States oil resources and encourage foreign production. Most of the policy makers recognized that American reserves were insufficient for the United States to continue to be the world's main supplier, let alone to be in a position to ''oil another war,'' as Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes put it.","page":"7","artlID":"4fd10d6d8eb7c8105d5c20ca","words":1173,"abstract":null,"date":"1980-08-03T00:00:00Z","keywords":[],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"After Politics, There's Rock, Disco or Pop Clubs to Visit; Rock-Disco Scene Bastions of Hard Rock Blues and Country Folk","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B03E4DE113BE732A2575BC0A96E9C94619FD6CF","leadPara":"MANHATTAN may not boast a particularly diverse range of pop concerts this week, but the city's club life for youthful forms of popular music remains more active and varied than anywhere else.","page":"C22","artlID":"4fc4a85e45c1498b0dac50c6","words":1326,"abstract":"guide to rock, disco and country music concerts and clubs in NYC during convention; illus (M)","date":"1980-08-08T00:00:00Z","keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"DEMOCRATIC PARTY"},{"name":"subject","value":"HOTELS, BARS, MOTELS, NIGHT CLUBS AND RESTAURANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"RESTAURANT REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"HOTELS, BARS, MOTELS, NIGHT CLUBS AND RESTAURANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"RESTAURANT REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1980"},{"name":"subject","value":"CONVENTIONS, NATIONAL"}],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"AFTER POLITICS, THERE'S ROCK, DISCO OR POP CLUBS TO VISIT","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9907E3D61239F93BA3575BC0A966948260","leadPara":"MANHATTAN may not boast a particularly diverse range of pop concerts this week, but the city's club life for youthful forms of popular music remains more active and varied than anywhere else.

After leaders of the walkout and Government representatives had met in Gdansk, there were conflicting reports on whether progress had been made. (Page A1, Column 6.) Polish strikers have set up an enclave at a sprawling shipyard in Gdansk that is self-governing and is publishing a daily newspaper circulating around the country. The strike leaders have established an elaborate administrative apparatus providing for guards, couriers and groups collecting donations and supplying food. (A1:5.) An Ethiopian attack on Somalia was reported by the Somali radio, which said that the raiding force was supported by fighter-bombers. (A3:1.) Canada lost two major newspapers as two publishing chains continued to divide up the country's shrinking industry. The Ottawa Journal abruptly halted operations after 95 years, leaving the capital with only one English-language newspaper. In Winnipeg, The Tribune suspended publication after a costly circulation war with the city's only other newspaper. (A3:1-3.) French Navy tugs smashed a blockade by fishermen at the country's largest oil-tanker terminal at Fos outside Marseilles for the second time in 10 days, using water cannon and tear-gas grenades. The fishermen fought back, hurling rocks and bolts. (A3:4-6.) National A large bomb left by extortionists blew up in a Lake Tahoe casino as experts used a remote-control device in an effort to defuse it. Thousands of people had been evacuated from the gambling district in Stateline, Nev., and no injuries were reported. The bomb was wheeled into an office in a hotel casino Tuesday by two people who said they were delivering a photocopying machine. The bomb was accompanied by a letter demanding $3 million. (A1:3-4.) The North won an energy aid dispute in the House. A proposal to change the formula for distribution of $1.8 billion in low-income fuel assistance was defeated by a vote of 215 to 199. The debate focused on a plan to increase the Sun Belt's share of such aid at the expense of the Frost Belt. (A1:1.) An editor and his wife were indicted by a county grand jury in Georgia on charges of having tried to aid the escape of four convicted killers from the State Prison. The couple were accused of attempting unsuccessfully in June to send hacksaw blades to the inmates. Four of them escaped July 28 after sawing through prison bars. (A1:1.) Miami is prospering as a magnet for tourism, shopping, banking and commerce. The recent shocks of rioting by blacks in the Liberty City area and the tidal wave of Cuban refugees that made Miami a catchword for both despair and hope are still deeply felt but surprisingly difficult to see. The major change, according to many businessmen, politicians and civic leaders, is the image of the city. (A1:2-4.) Senator Mike Gravel was defeated in Alaska's Democratic primary by Clark Gruening, a lawyer, after a bitter campaign that focused on the sources of the Gravel campaign financing and on his inability to block a Senate bill barring development of millions of acres in the state. (A12:1-2.) Clarifying a remark by Ronald Reagan was undertaken by his staff after he declared that President Carter ''has created a severe depression.'' The chief economic adviser of the Republican Presidential nominee acknowledged that most economists believed the nation was in ''a very severe recession,'' not a depression. (B9:1-2.) A research agency is threatened with erosion of its long-cherished independence, in the view of many scientists. At issue is a bill nearing a vote in the House that would require the budget of the National Institutes of Health to be regularly reauthorized by Congress, which is required for most Government agencies, and for a yearly spending ceiling to be set by Congress. (D19:1-2.) The disclosure of a key arms advance stirred rising controversy. Members of a House panel, after hearing sworn testimony, charged that secret information on the development of a plane that is nearly undetectable by Soviet radar was leaked to a reporter so that the Pentagon could justify announcing the achievement. (A16:1-2.) Metropolitan A tentative accord in the PATH strike was reached after 11 weeks by negotiators for the railroad and the 177 striking carmen. The agreement will be submitted to a ratification vote by the union members tomorrow, and full service was expected to be restored for the morning rush Tuesday. Details of the accord were not disclosed. (A1:2.) Two views of Jacob K. Javits's health are portrayed in contrasting television campaign commercials. The Senator raised the issue when he disclosed last February that he had motor-neuron disease. It is a chronic condition that damages nerves, causes muscles to wither and is usually progressive. His doctors describe Senator Javits as ''vigorous'' and say they believe that he can serve another term. (A1:5-6.) An oil tax has had unexpected results in Connecticut. The original targets of the new 2 percent levy on the gross receipts of oil companies were their profits, but the burden is apparently falling mainly on homeowners and small fuel dealers and may soon be passed on to motorists too.

If you belonged to ''labor,'' you worked a 12 to 15 hour day, without overtime, for wages and nothing more; if you belonged to ''management'' you owned - often by inheritance - a business. Businesses were smaller then and supervisors were more often part of labor than part of management. As we celebrate our 98th Labor Day, the roles of labor and management are not so clear-cut. In certain significant instances, they have almost become reversed. For example, today, when many workers are contractually protected against having to work excessive hours to keep their jobs, many executives at the same companies commonly labor 12 to 15 hours daily, six or seven days per week, just to hold their present positions. Since this is the era of the professional manager and the publicly-held corporation, today's executive does not own the business he helps manage. Consequently, today's manager is essentially a worker, a ''laborer'' - albeit a well-paid one who works in decent surroundings.","page":"13","artlID":"4fd115cb8eb7c8105d5cbfce","words":715,"abstract":null,"date":"1980-09-01T00:00:00Z","keywords":[],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"Split of U.S. Circuit Court in South Near Enactment After Long Debate; Split of U.S. Judicial Circuit in South Near Enactment After Long Debate Criticism of Earlier Proposal Changes in Congress and Courts Several Groups Drop Opposition","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9405E0DB1E3BE732A25752C0A96F9C94619FD6CF","leadPara":"WASHINGTON--Sixteen years after the idea was broached, a proposal to split the Deep South's Fifth Federal judicial circuit, where many of the nation's key civil rights cases evolved, appears headed for Congressional enactment.","page":"A1","artlID":"4fc4a81e45c1498b0dac409e","words":1721,"abstract":"Proposal to split Deep South's Fifth Federal Judicial District, where many of nation's key civil rights cases evolved, appears headed for Congressional enactment; controversial proposal had evoked emotional opposition from civil rights groups who feared action would blunt court's progressive record on civil rights cases; only NAACP remains wary; proposal reviewed (M)","date":"1980-09-01T00:00:00Z","keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"subject","value":"COURTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"APPEALS COURTS (US)"}],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"Executives Work, Too","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F01EFDB1E3BE732A25752C0A96F9C94619FD6CF","leadPara":"PARSIPPANY, N.J.--In 1882, when Peter J.

Isn't Poland a socialist country?'' The father, relating the incident in Washington last week with visible distress, said he had to ponder this 64 zillion zloty question before he could assemble a Delphic response to the son: ''Socialists make mistakes, too ...and some Socialists make big mistakes.'' In the light of three weeks of widespread strikes in Poland and labor disturbances in other Soviet bloc countries in recent years, some Communists are wondering whether the venerable boast of erecting ''the dictatorship of the proletariat'' has grown hollow. Marxist-Leninist ideology has long held that strikes were not possible in Communist societies because ''workers cannot strike against their own interests.'' A philosophical dictionary published in East Berlin defines ''strike'' as something that happens only ''under capitalism.'' However, Communist countries have avoided expressly forbidding strikes, on the principle that ''what cannot be, will not be.'' Thus, as these countries told the United Nations last year, none has laws mentioning strikes.","page":"4","artlID":"4fd10a428eb7c8105d5bd639","words":963,"abstract":null,"date":"1980-09-07T00:00:00Z","keywords":[],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"Senator Javits, Above All","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9507E7DE1739F934A3575AC0A966948260","leadPara":"The main question in New York's Senate race is whether Jacob Javits deserves re-election to a fifth term.

Sensing a politically popular issue in this election year, Congressmen have been trying to outdo one another in devising solutions to the problem. President Carter's recent proposal to grant a limited deduction to working couples puts the official stamp of approval on the effort. Under the law, when one spouse does not work or earns less than 20 percent of total family income, the couple generally pays the lowest tax rates. However, when both spouses work and earn roughly the same salary, they pay the highest rates, while single people and heads of household pay rates somewhere in between. The marriage tax on working couples can be as much as 7.4 percent of their after-tax income.","page":"2","artlID":"4fd115c38eb7c8105d5cbb67","words":943,"abstract":null,"date":"1980-09-09T00:00:00Z","keywords":[],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"A 'MR.

If one looks under the rhetoric about the the ''me decade'' and the meanness supposedly poisoning the American psyche, evidence of a new spirit of civic idealism and community self-help can be found everywhere.","page":"35","artlID":"4fd116358eb7c8105d5cd129","words":750,"abstract":null,"date":"1980-10-10T00:00:00Z","keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"VOLUNTEERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"DEMOCRACY (THEORYAND PHILOSOPHY)"}],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"Welcome to Doeville","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E02E3D71F3BE732A25753C1A9669D94619FD6CF","leadPara":"MINNEAPOLIS--Despite Edward M.

Songs like ''Message in a Bottle,'' ''Walking on the Moon'' and ''The Bed's Too Big Without You'' became FM radio favorites and the album sold well. Having penetrated the lucrative American market, most British groups would have devoted several months to intensive touring and promotional activities in the United States. Instead, Miles Copeland, the Police's unconventional manager, arranged a world tour that found the band playing in Bombay and other cities where live rock has rarely been heard. The tour may not have consolidated the group's position in America, but it does seem to have provided food for thought. The third Police album, ''Zenyatta Mondatta,'' released earlier this week, isn't a radical departure from the distinctive style developed on the first two LP's, but the band's emphasis has shifted. A reggae influence pervaded the Police's earlier music, and their lyrics tended to focus on personal concerns. Now reggae is simply one of a number of international colorings that lend variety to the group's sound and a number of new songs, especially those written by Sting, the bassist and lead vocalist, reflect the impact of travel in alien cultures.","page":"8","artlID":"4fd10ab78eb7c8105d5be3ae","words":1092,"abstract":null,"date":"1980-10-10T00:00:00Z","keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"RECORDINGS AND RECORDING EQUIPMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"CONCERTS AND RECITALS"}],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"Memories of 1970 Quebec Crisis Raised in Canada Charter Debate; Climate of Fear Recalled Use of Referendums Proposed Denounced as 'Loaded Dice'","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B05E2DA1631E732A25752C1A9669D94619FD6CF","leadPara":"OTTAWA, Oct. 10--The federal Parliament is debating the constitutional future of Canada just 10 years after one of the most dramatic moments of its history, the Quebec crisis of October 1970, when a handful of extreme nationalists resorted to kidnapping and murder to promote independence for the province.","page":"20","artlID":"4fc4a46145c1498b0dab3a0d","words":910,"abstract":"debate coincides with 10th anniversary of Quebec crisis of October '70; 2 events were linked in House of Commons this week by critics of Government, who accused it of trying to manipulate public opinion and of opening door to same kind of abuses of public liberties that occurred 10 years ago in Quebec; 3-year study of events made on behalf of Min of Justice by Quebec public prosecutor, Jean-Francois Duchaine, has just been released; it absolved federal Government of suspicion that it 'invented' crisis in order to stamp out nationalism in Quebec, but charged both federal and local officials used crisis as pretext to engage in repression unwarranted by situation; former Prime Min Joe Clark and Lorne Nystrom, spokesman for leftist New Democratic Party, comment (M)","date":"1980-10-11T00:00:00Z","keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"CANADA"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"No Headline","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E00E7DA1F39F932A25753C1A966948260","leadPara":"The federal Parliament is debating the constitutional future of Canada just 10 years after one of the most dramatic moments of its history, the Quebec crisis of October 1970, when a handful of extreme nationalists resorted to kidnapping and murder to promote independence for the province.

It will be made by television viewers in their homes in New York, Los Angeles and a dozen other cities where the choice involves bypassing the election-night banter of Messrs. Cronkite, Chancellor and Reynolds, in favor of watching the Academy Award-winning Vietnam War drama, ''The Deer Hunter.'' If enough viewers cast their ''vote'' for ''The Deer Hunter'' - which its New York City outlet, WOR-TV/Channel 9, warns ''contains dramatic subject matter and dialogue suitable only for mature audiences'' - it could have major implications for the future of television. The issue to be decided - or at least illuminated - is how far television may go in the showing of sex and violence. All three conventional broadcast networks - CBS, NBC and ABC - have rejected ''The Deer Hunter'' as too violent for television, while all the pay-cable networks - including Home Box Office and Showtime - as well as several local broadcast stations, including WOR-TV, deemed it acceptable. These differing standards raise important questions: Are some conventional broadcasters significantly liberalizing their views toward so-called adult material? If so, does the trend reflect a changing society or is it more the result of competitive pressure from cable and other forms of home video? Furthermore, as increased attention is focused on standards of taste and discretion, what will come of television's - especially network television's - procedures for self-censorship?","page":"1","artlID":"4fd10bbb8eb7c8105d5bfa46","words":2727,"abstract":null,"date":"1980-11-02T00:00:00Z","keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MOTION PICTURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"VIOLENCE"},{"name":"subject","value":"STATIONS AND NETWORKS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TELEVISION"},{"name":"subject","value":"PUBLIC TELEVISION"}],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"What's Allowed on TV --Pressures for Change Are Mounting; What's Allowed on TV","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C03E1DB1038E432A25751C0A9679D94619FD6CF","leadPara":"Among the many decisions to be made this election day, one in particular will not be made at the polls.

World famous rock groups are finding it difficult to fill stadiums, record companies are complaining of rising costs and sagging sales figures, but the city is supporting more rock-and-roll clubs than ever before and new ones are opening with some frequency. Apparently, a growing number of rock-and-roll fans would rather go to a club, where they can dance to the music, buy drinks, feel closer to the performers and socialize with their friends, than pay up to twice as much money for a ticket to a concert by a supergroup. The clubs are getting fancier, too. A year ago, the ''in'' spots were mostly dark and functional; one went for the music and the cameraderie, not to admire the decor. But 1980 saw the opening of the Ritz, a roomy Art Deco palace on East 11th Street; Howard Stein's Rock Lounge, another well appointed new club at 285 West Broadway, and the resuscitated Peppermint Lounge, 128 West 45th Street. This weekend the cavernous Rock City, 157 Hudson Street, two blocks below Canal Street, opens its door for the first time. And the clubs that started it all -CBGB, Max's Kansas City, Hurrah, and the rest - are holding their own.","page":"1","artlID":"4fd111b08eb7c8105d5c86bc","words":1499,"abstract":null,"date":"1980-12-26T00:00:00Z","keywords":[],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"Squarely on the Left; Walzer","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B07E7DE1030E532A2575BC2A9649D94619FD6CF","leadPara":"MICHAEL WALZER is a prominent teacher of political philosophy, but in this volume he does not deal primarily with \"deep theory,\" of which he finds Marxism most persuasive.

Nineteen-eighty was a year of economic retrenchment, of sweeping electoral victories for conservative politicians, of escapism at the movies and sullen muttering in the streets, and pop reflected all these things. There was a definite drift to the right. Middle-of-the-road pop (Kenny Rogers, Barbra Streisand) topped the albums and singles charts. Hordes of former disco fans traded in their dancing shoes for cowboy boots, and black sweet-harmony groups like Ray, Goodman and Brown enjoyed renewed popularity. At the same time, more progressive music was on the march. Rock's new wave may have splintered into several disparate and sometimes hostile camps, but the Clash, the Police and other new wave artists finally justified their fans' faith in them by making it big commercially. The music's more daring experimenters, from the venerable Captain Beefheart to the younger Talking Heads and Public Image Ltd., produced new work that even their fans found unexpectedly provocative. And while disco all but collapsed as a movement, the long anticipated alliance between black American disco and funk, new wave rock, and Jamaican reggae and other Third World pop began to seem not just possible but inevitable.","page":"19","artlID":"4fd11cbe8eb7c8105d5da297","words":1793,"abstract":null,"date":"1980-12-28T00:00:00Z","keywords":[],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"Use of TV in Real Estate Gains","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=950CE7DE1030E532A2575BC2A9649D94619FD6CF","leadPara":"What happens to property values in the wake of a Three Mile Island or a Love Canal?

By Linda K. Kerber. Illustrated. 304 pp. Chapel Hill, N.C.: Published for the Instituute of Early American History and Culture. The University of North Carolina Press. Cloth, $19.50. Paper, $9. LET us admit at the outset that the history of the American Revolution can be told without so much as mentioning a woman, and - except for an occasional reference to Abigail Adams or Mercy Otis Warren - it generally is. The Revolution was a political event, and politics had no place in the traditional ''woman's sphere.'' Women remained at home, locked in a round of tasks so enduring that they can be regarded as ''historical'' only in the details of their execution, tasks the woman themselves regarded as dreary and of little status in the scale of human events. And yet, as we are frequently reminded, the female half of mankind must have a history: not to have a history is to be nobody. In the cause of recovering women's history, not one but two books were published this year on women in the late 18th-century: Mary Beth Norton's ''Liberty's Daughters: The Revolutionary Experience of American Women, 1750-1800'' and now Linda K. Kerber's ''Women of the Republic.''","page":"6","artlID":"4fd10de38eb7c8105d5c30ca","words":973,"abstract":null,"date":"1980-12-28T00:00:00Z","keywords":[],"media":[]},{"year":1980,"headline":"FEUDING OF BRAZIL'S CHURCH AND MILITARY GROWS BITTER","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C01E7D61F39F93BA15751C1A966948260","leadPara":"Five months after the stirring tour of Brazil by Pope John Paul II quelled feuding between the church and the military leaders, relations between them have plunged to a new low.
