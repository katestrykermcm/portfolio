She is survived by her husband of nearly 59 years, Robert Elliot Hinerfeld; two sons, Daniel Slocum (Laura Kleinhenz) and Matthew Ben (Nora Jaskowiak, MD); and five grandchildren, Sophie Rose, Eli Milton, Theo Jonathan, Willa Belle and Maude Hall. Susan was born in New York City, August 6, 1936, to Milton Jonathan Slocum, MD and Belle Esther Slocum (nee, Gibralter). Milton often walked Susan to the Calhoun School in the morning, quizzing her on Latin along the way. Susan graduated from Calhoun in 1953 and from Wellesley College in 1957. In 1959, Susan and Robert moved from Cambridge, MA to Los Angeles, where Susan worked for the public relations counselor Elaine K. Sewell Jones, wife of architect A. Quincy Jones. To get the job, Susan took a one-question exam: name the middle initial of the first director of the Museum of Modern Art. Susan instantly replied \"H,\" for Alfred H. Barr, Jr., and began a job and a lifelong friendship with the Joneses. Through them she became acquainted with Ray and Charles Eames and developed a love of design and modernist architecture. Decades later, Susan's son Matthew worked for Ray on her final book project. Susan was a great reader, an elegant writer and an exacting editor. She was co-author, with her father, of Manhattan Country Doctor, a best-selling memoir of Dr. Slocum's 34-year medical practice in Hell's Kitchen (Scribner's, 1986). Susan edited Wellesley After-Images (1974) and was a regular book reviewer for the Los Angeles Times. She often edited Robert's appellate briefs. Susan used her love of language, literature, design, art and architecture to teach her sons and their friends to be better writers, better observers, and more creative people. Many of them credit Susan's encouragement, instruction and editorial rigor with getting them into college and graduate school and helping them launch successful careers. Susan invested time and energy in the progressive schools her children attended, Westland and Crossroads. She had a wide circle of friends, young and old, and her home was a special gathering place where lives intersected, ideas and laughter flourished, and those in need found refuge. Susan was charming, stylish, nurturing, funny, brilliant, playful, selfless and kind. She was adored by all who knew her and loved dearly by her family. As a toddler, when Susan's parents asked her to do something against her wishes, she replied: \"Has I has to?\" That, Susan said in recent months, was her question about dying.

Born in New York City to B.P. and Adeline Jaffe Schulberg, she moved with her parents and older brother Budd to Los Angeles, where her father was head of production at Paramount Studios. Sonya came to love sun, horses, dogs and Malibu, where Ad built one of the first houses. At the insistence of their mother, who had a literary agency in NYC from 1945 until 1977, Sonya, Budd and younger brother Stuart became writers. She attended The Progressive School, co-founded by her mother. After her parents' divorce, Sonya attended schools in Paris, Geneva and London. She started Sarah Lawrence but left at 19 when Scribners published her first novel (Maxwell Perkins was her editor). Budd's first novel, What Makes Sammy Run, made a bigger splash and Budd went on to success as a screenwriter (On the Waterfront). Sonya was married to attorney Ben O'Sullivan from 1941 until his death in 1998. Sadly, their son John O'Sullivan died in 2010. Her dear friends, brothers Budd and Stuart, also predeceased her. She is survived by other close friends: her daughter Dr. Chris O'Sullivan of NYC and Mamaroneck, Budd's and Stuart's children, among them Vicky Kingsland, Benn, Sandra, K.C., Peter and Jonathan Schulberg; her nieces Elizabeth Frank and Beth O'Sullivan; and her grandchildren Sarah and Kate O'Sullivan and great-grandson Will McCullough of Washington, DC and Betsy Schulberg. Wherever she lived, she adopted dogs and cats, tended wild animals, created gardens (on Martha's Vineyard and in Mamaroneck). She published short stories and recently completed a witty sad novel with perfectly constructed sentences about growing up in Hollywood. She was buried in the West Tisbury Cemetery on Martha's Vineyard. A reception will be held at her home in Mamaroneck in mid June.

Sonya came to love sun, horses, dogs and Malibu, where Ad built one of the first houses. At the insistence of their mother, who had a literary agency in NYC from 1945 until 1977, Sonya, Budd and younger brother Stuart became writers. She attended The Progressive School, co-founded by her mother. After her parents' divorce, Sonya attended schools in Paris, Geneva and London. She started Sarah Lawrence but left at 19 when Scribners published her first novel (Maxwell Perkins was her editor). Budd's first novel, What Makes Sammy Run, made a bigger splash and Budd went on to success as a screenwriter (On the Waterfront). Sonya was married to attorney Ben O'Sullivan from 1941 until his death in 1998. Sadly, their son John O'Sullivan died in 2010. Her dear friends, brothers Budd and Stuart, also predeceased her. She is survived by other close friends: her daughter Dr. Chris O'Sullivan of NYC and Mamaroneck, Budd's and Stuart's children, among them Vicky Kingsland, Benn, Sandra, K.C., Peter and Jonathan Schulberg; her nieces Elizabeth Frank and Beth O'Sullivan; and her grandchildren Sarah and Kate O'Sullivan and great-grandson Will McCullough of Washington, DC and Betsy Schulberg. Wherever she lived, she adopted dogs and cats, tended wild animals, created gardens (on Martha's Vineyard and in Mamaroneck). She published short stories and recently completed a witty sad novel with perfectly constructed sentences about growing up in Hollywood. She was buried in the West Tisbury Cemetery on Martha's Vineyard. A reception will be held at her home in Mamaroneck in mid June. Sonya would have liked contributions to one of the many animal organizations she supported, including the Doris Day Animal Foundation, 8033 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 845, Los Angeles, CA 90046 or donate in memoriam online at DDAF. 1/3","page":"15","artlID":"5763687438f0d83da36e05ed","words":"336","abstract":null,"date":"2016-06-09T00:00:00Z","keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"O'SULLIVAN, SONYA
