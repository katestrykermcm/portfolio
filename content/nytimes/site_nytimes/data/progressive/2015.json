origins to become a trail-blazing executive and an influential presence at the highest levels of American business, academia, philanthropy, and public service, died peacefully at her Greenwich Village home on Saturday morning. Born in 1925 in Jamestown, NY, G.G. graduated from Penn State University and from Columbia Law School, where she was one of six women in the class of 1947. At Columbia Law, she met and married Horace Michelson, a classmate whose quiet brilliance perfectly complemented G.G.'s sparkling extroversion. He introduced her to another great love, the New York Yankees, for whom she developed what this newspaper would decades later describe as an \"unswerving devotion.\" After law school, G.G. joined the Executive Training Squad at R.H. Macy & Co., the retailer, where she would continue to work, in a series of increasingly senior positions in labor relations, human resources, and external affairs, until her 1992 retirement (She remained a Senior Advisor and Director until the company's merger with Federated Department Stores, at which point she joined that company's board). With each appointment, to Vice President in 1963, then to Senior Vice President for Labor and Consumer Relations in 1970 and to Macy's New York Executive Committee and Board of Directors that same year, G.G. was almost invariably the first female to have risen so high. But she quickly won over those unaccustomed to dealing with women in managerial roles, establishing a reputation as a firm but fair-minded labor negotiator (she was responsible for collective bargaining with the Teamsters and fourteen union locals, representing a total of twenty thousand employees) and helped Macy's successfully navigate the workforce challenges associated with the legal and social upheavals of the 1960s and the consumer movement of the 1970s. In 1971, G.G. was named to the Board of Directors of the Quaker Oats Corporation and over the course of the next three decades she served as director of numerous important American corporations, including General Electric, Goodyear Tire & Rubber, the Stanley Works, Chubb Insurance, Irving Trust, and Harper & Row; and as President of the Board of Overseers of TIAA-CREF; a member of the Executive Board of the American Arbitration Association and a Governor of the American Stock Exchange. When these responsibilities took G.G. to board meetings and similar events, Horace, by then a high-powered partner at a New York law firm but an ever-stalwart booster of his spouse's career, played his assigned role, taking his place at luncheons and garden tours organized for the \"wives\" of the corporations' directors. G.G's commitments and leadership roles extended beyond corporate boardrooms. She served on the boards of Spellman College and of the RAND Corporation, whose Graduate University awarded her an honorary Ph.D. in 2002. In 1980, she was named to the Board of Trustees of Columbia University and was elected its Chair in 1989 the first woman to lead the overseers of an Ivy League institution. It was during her tenure on the board that the University decided to admit women to Columbia College, after 229 years as a male-only institution. She was named to the National Commission on the Public Service; served as Deputy Chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; was a long-serving Director of the New York City Partnership and a Director of the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York; served on the Emergency Financial Control Board, the state entity established in the wake of the New York City fiscal crisis of the 1970s; and was appointed to numerous commissions by Mayors Koch, Dinkins, and Bloomberg. In these many roles, G.G. endeared herself to colleagues through her sharp intelligence, geniality, and commitment to hard work. She approached board appointments as work, not honors, and discharged her responsibilities diligently. Surrounded by other powerful leaders accustomed to having their own way, G.G., true to her background in progressive labor relations and consumer affairs, earned a reputation as a conciliator par excellence though not, as a colleague emphasized, one of the \"peace at any price\" stripe. An enduring aspect of G.G.'s professional legacy stems from her role, spanning decades, as a mentor and friend to newly-minted Macy's executives and to a much broader circle of younger people who sought her out for advice and support as they began to make their way in the business, philanthropic, and academic worlds. Seeing these people advance to positions of leadership was a source of particular pride for G.G., and they--and the hundreds of rank-and-file Macy's employees whom she had come to know and help in myriad ways repaid her generosity with warm friendship and steadfast loyalty. G.G. was a devoted mother and grandmother and a doting great-grandmother and a central, beloved figure in two unusually close-knit extended families, her own and her husband's. She is survived by her sister, Mildred Terr, of Las Vegas, New Mexico; her daughter, Barbara Michelson and son-in-law Jim Heffron; her three granddaughters Phoebe, Sarah, and Claude; and four great-grandchildren, as well as legion friends, admirers, and others whose lives she enriched. Her husband Horace and her daughter Martha predeceased her. Plans for a memorial service will be announced at a later date.

She was named to the National Commission on the Public Service; served as Deputy Chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; was a long-serving Director of the New York City Partnership and a Director of the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York; served on the Emergency Financial Control Board, the state entity established in the wake of the New York City fiscal crisis of the 1970s; and was appointed to numerous commissions by Mayors Koch, Dinkins, and Bloomberg. In these many roles, G.G. endeared herself to colleagues through her sharp intelligence, geniality, and commitment to hard work. She approached board appointments as work, not honors, and discharged her responsibilities diligently. Surrounded by other powerful leaders accustomed to having their own way, G.G., true to her background in progressive labor relations and consumer affairs, earned a reputation as a conciliator par excellence though not, as a colleague emphasized, one of the \"peace at any price\" stripe. An enduring aspect of G.G.'s professional legacy stems from her role, spanning decades, as a mentor and friend to newly-minted Macy's executives and to a much broader circle of younger people who sought her out for advice and support as they began to make their way in the business, philanthropic, and academic worlds. Seeing these people advance to positions of leadership was a source of particular pride for G.G., and they--and the hundreds of rank-and-file Macy's employees whom she had come to know and help in myriad ways repaid her generosity with warm friendship and steadfast loyalty. G.G. was a devoted mother and grandmother and a doting great-grandmother and a central, beloved figure in two unusually close-knit extended families, her own and her husband's. She is survived by her sister, Mildred Terr, of Las Vegas, New Mexico; her daughter, Barbara Michelson and son-in-law Jim Heffron; her three granddaughters Phoebe, Sarah, and Claude; and four great-grandchildren, as well as legion friends, admirers, and others whose lives she enriched. Her husband Horace and her daughter Martha predeceased her. Plans for a memorial service will be announced at a later date.

Born in 1925 in Jamestown, NY, G.G. graduated from Penn State University and from Columbia Law School, where she was one of six women in the class of 1947. At Columbia Law, she met and married Horace Michelson, a classmate whose quiet brilliance perfectly complemented G.G.'s sparkling extroversion. He introduced her to another great love, the New York Yankees, for whom she developed what this newspaper would decades later describe as an \"unswerving devotion.\" After law school, G.G. joined the Executive Training Squad at R.H. Macy & Co., the retailer, where she would continue to work, in a series of increasingly senior positions in labor relations, human resources, and external affairs, until her 1992 retirement (She remained a Senior Advisor and Director until the company's merger with Federated Department Stores, at which point she joined that company's board). With each appointment, to Vice President in 1963, then to Senior Vice President for Labor and Consumer Relations in 1970 and to Macy's New York Executive Committee and Board of Directors that same year, G.G. was almost invariably the first female to have risen so high. But she quickly won over those unaccustomed to dealing with women in managerial roles, establishing a reputation as a firm but fair-minded labor negotiator (she was responsible for collective bargaining with the Teamsters and fourteen union locals, representing a total of twenty thousand employees) and helped Macy's successfully navigate the workforce challenges associated with the legal and social upheavals of the 1960s and the consumer movement of the 1970s. In 1971, G.G. was named to the Board of Directors of the Quaker Oats Corporation and over the course of the next three decades she served as director of numerous important American corporations, including General Electric, Goodyear Tire & Rubber, the Stanley Works, Chubb Insurance, Irving Trust, and Harper & Row; and as President of the Board of Overseers of TIAA-CREF; a member of the Executive Board of the American Arbitration Association and a Governor of the American Stock Exchange. When these responsibilities took G.G. to board meetings and similar events, Horace, by then a high-powered partner at a New York law firm but an ever-stalwart booster of his spouse's career, played his assigned role, taking his place at luncheons and garden tours organized for the \"wives\" of the corporations' directors. G.G's commitments and leadership roles extended beyond corporate boardrooms. She served on the boards of Spellman College and of the RAND Corporation, whose Graduate University awarded her an honorary Ph.D. in 2002. In 1980, she was named to the Board of Trustees of Columbia University and was elected its Chair in 1989 the first woman to lead the overseers of an Ivy League institution. It was during her tenure on the board that the University decided to admit women to Columbia College, after 229 years as a male-only institution.

June 19, 1919 -January 3, 2015. A woman of valor, courage and principle. Starting life as one of Dr. Martin A. Couney's famous Coney Island incubator babies, she went on to lead a life of drama and high excitement, participating in some of the most important social and political issues and events of the 20th Century. She was the only child of pioneering labor leader and political firebrand David Dubinsky, President of The International Ladies Garment Workers Union, and his wife and partner Emma. Born at the close of World War I, she lived through the Depression and participated in the Second World War. She met and knew some of the most important figures of the time, beginning with every President since Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt. A graduate at age nineteen of New York University, she studied there with the legendary philosopher Sidney Hook. She was married to Captain Lester Narins by Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, whom her parents knew and worked with intimately. She was a student of, witness to, and participant in history. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, she worked with her father and the free democratic labor movement in this country to support, sustain and rescue struggling democratic labor leaders and movements in war-ravaged Europe. As unofficial aide-de- camp for her father and mother, she knew and worked with the great and the good, including General George C. Marshall; Financier and statesman Bernard Baruch; Philosopher John Dewey, the great pioneer in education and pragmatist thought; His Holiness Pope Pius XII; Premier Leon Blum of France; President Giuseppe Saragat of Italy; Mrs. Roosevelt; Joe Lash, friend of and biographer of Mrs. Roosevelt and her life with FDR; ground breaking United States Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins; John L. Lewis, iconic and towering President of the United Mine Workers Union; Walter Reuther and his brothers, champions of the United Automobile Workers Union; A. Philip Randolph, historic leader of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo; Pablo Casals; Marian Anderson; Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher; Luis Munoz Marin of Puerto Rico; Hubert H. Humphrey; Adlai Stevenson II; Arthur Koestler; Nelson Rockefeller; Golda Meir; Yitzhak Rabin, and the founding greats of the State of Israel; Art Historians Meyer Schapiro and Andre Chastel, through whom she had the privilege of seeing the Lascaux Caves before they were sealed; Sir Isaiah Berlin; Orson Welles and his Mercury Theatre Company; practically every Governor and Mayor of the State and City of New York since her birth and most of the liberal and progressive politicians throughout the United States. She had a long and happy second marriage to Shelley Appleton, Secretary Treasurer of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and Chairman Emeritus of The World ORT Union. During this time The Fashion Institute of Technology asked her to found, develop and lead their first Jewelry History Department and through that work she connected with the great jewelry historians and museum jewelry departments throughout Europe. She then went on to found the American Society of Jewelry Historians. She was President Emeritus of the ASJH at the time of her death. She loved life and had a wonderful, rich and unique one. She was always interested in the new, and principled and determined in her thought. She was a voracious reader in subjects ranging widely from history to espionage, memoir, critical thought and beyond. Her mind was remarkable to her final days, which she lived with dignity and strength. She is survived by her beloved daughter Ryna, her cherished granddaughter, Emma, and countless friends at home and around the world. The family will be receiving, which will be announced privately. A memorial service will be scheduled at a later date and will be announced. 1/3","page":"20","artlID":"54cef76538f0d863f8d50c42","words":"628","abstract":null,"date":"2015-01-25T00:00:00Z","keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"APPLETON, JEAN DUBINSKY"}],"media":[]},{"year":2015,"headline":"Paid Notice: Deaths  FENTON, MARILYN K.","url":"https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E1DB173AF936A15752C0A9639D8B63","leadPara":"FENTON--Marilyn K.,passed away on January 22, 2015, at the age of 88, surrounded by her family.

Born in Brooklyn, August 28, 1929, died in her Manhattan home on January 31, 2015. Educated in Catholic schools, she further received a BS degree from Queens College, and a MS in Social Work from Columbia University. A Social Worker for many years, she championed the rights of children, incarcerated women, and ex-offenders. Many social programs throughout New York City benefit today from Barbara's relentless efforts and skillful fundraising. She retired in 2011 at the age of 82 from West Side Federation for Senior Housing and Support Services (WSFSSH) after twenty-one years as the Director of Development. Barbara had a progressive spirit and was particularly talented at organization, preparation and inclusiveness, tempered by spontaneity and a zeal for having fun. Barbara's talents shone in her position as Director of Community Liaison in the Office of the New York City Council President (1977-1979). They also led to her successes in acquiring funding and grants for many service agencies: Project Green Hope (1980-1986) and the Fortune Society (1980-1986) as Development Director and Grants Administrator, both supportive services for ex-prisoners, male and female; the AIDS Services Delivery Consortium as Director (1987); and West Side Federation for Senior Housing and Support Services (WSFSSH), as Directory of Development (1980-2011). Up until her last illness, Barbara for many years co-chaired the Community Board Number Seven, Committee for Health and Human Services. Barbara was deeply religious, and viewed her faith as including social and community responsibility. Her staunch beliefs, and extraordinary talents in organizing social movements propelled her into leadership roles in progressive activities such as Call to Action. As a progressive she had a keen interest in feminist initiatives. Barbara loved New York City and all it offers. Barbara frequently traveled with friends. She was fun to be with and to go out with. She will be greatly missed. Barbara is survived by her brother Jerome, her sister-in-law Mary; niece Michele Van Buren Kiefer; nephews David Van Buren and Christopher Van Holmes; grand-nieces Jean Van Buren, Skye Terebey, Carlin Van Holmes, Madison Van Holmes and Aurora Kiefer; and grand-nephew Edward Kiefer.

hspace=\"10\">CHIRELSTEIN--Marvin A.<br/><br/> Columbia Law School Professor Emeritus Marvin A. Chirelstein, a leading scholar of federal taxation, corporate law, and contracts whose textbooks are still used by students across the country, died on February 16. He was 86. Chirelstein first joined Columbia Law School in 1954 to work on the Federal Income Tax Project under Dean William C. Warren. He then joined the government as an attorney in the U.S. Department of the Treasury and later taught at Rutgers School of Law and Yale Law School. Chirelstein returned to Columbia Law School as a visiting professor in 1981 and became a full-time faculty member in 1984. Two years later, he was named the first Isidor and Seville Sulzbacher Professor of Law, an appointment announced by then-Columbia University President Michael I. Sovern. In addition to being a highly sought after academic expert on taxation, contracts, and corporate law, Chirelstein was a beloved professor who once taught a seminar on the legal side of one of his favorite sports: boxing. A music lover who played the violin, he was known for his dry sense of humor and quiet wit and was adored by students. Two of his textbooks, Concepts and Case Analysis in the Law of Contracts and Federal Income Taxation: A Law Students Guide to the Leading Cases and Concepts, have guided generations of future lawyers through the complexities of the law. A third, Cases and Materials on Corporate Finance, opened the way to interdisciplinary analysis of corporate law. Teaching was Chirelsteins passion, in addition to tax. Upon his appointment to the faculty in 1984, Chirelstein told the Columbia Law School News that he considered himself an educator at heart. As a professor at Yale Law School from 1965 to 1981, Chirelstein taught three future Columbia Law faculty colleagues: John C. Coffee Jr., Merritt B. Fox, and Ronald J. Gilson. He also taught future U.S. President Bill Clinton, who commented: \"I had the privilege of having Professor Chirelstein for both Tax Law and Corporate Finance at Yale--he was memorably patient with me in the former, and seemed pleased when I redeemed myself in the latter. He had a great sense of humor, forgiving me for reading One Hundred Years of Solitude in class and laughing at my answer when asked how I could be such a bad tax student and do so well in corporate finance: I said it was a lot like politics--someone's trying to gain at someone else's expense, and there have to be rules to avoid fraud and violence. It was the beginning of a long, if long distance, friendship. Professor Chirelstein, as I neared graduation, told me about a teaching vacancy at the University of Arkansas Law School in Fayetteville, and recommended me for a job that enriched and changed my life. I'll always be grateful for his gifted teaching, endless curiosity, and generous spirit.\" For Prof. Fox, Chirelstein first kindled his interest in corporate finance. \"Students looked forward to going to Chirelsteins class every day, Fox said. He was remarkably incisive and sophisticated in his treatment of the issues, while at the same time being incredibly funny. It is a source of real pleasure that my son, Peter Fox 09, was able to have the same experience, taking tax with Chirelstein here at Columbia Law School. A trusted adviser, Chirelstein was often asked to provide commentary on taxation policies or reform efforts. In a 1994 Letter to the Editor published in The New York Times, Chirelstein supported President Clintons progressive taxation. . . . the distribution of national income has grown increasingly unequal over the last dozen years, at least in part as a consequence of the tax legislation that President Reagan put over on a gullible public, Chirelstein wrote in the Times. We are constantly told that American voters are disaffected, that they suffer from a political malaise, that they no longer trust their political leaders, and so on. Surely one reason is a growing sense that economic progress has been for the few. Progressive taxation won't solve the problem. But it helps, both actually and as a symbol of our national ideals. On Tax Day in 1998, Chirelstein appeared on PBS NewsHour with Jim Lehrer to again defend the U.S. tax system despite its complexities, which he attributed to Congress trying to administer too many programs through the tax code. We collect a trillion, three hundred billion dollars a year through the administration of our tax laws, and thats done largely by voluntary compliance, he said. I think anyone would regard that as an immense achievement. Professor John Coffee, who first met Chirelstein as a student at Yale Law School said Chirelstein was a Man for All Seasons. His students immediately learned that he had a martini-dry wit, a razor-sharp mind, but a uniquely self-effacing teaching method under which he convinced students that he needed their help to solve a seemingly simple problem on the blackboard, Coffee recalled. During the 1970s, his influential work with Victor Brudney illuminated the field of corporate law, but also showed that he was committed to fairness and preferred background norms of equality and equal treatment. Chirelstein graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1950. He earned his J.D. from the University of Chicago Law School in 1953 and served as editor-in-chief of the University of Chicago Law Review. He is survived by his wife, Ellen, and his son, Paul.

In both his personal and professional life, he was admired for his dedication, leadership, kindness and gentlemanly qualities. Before retiring in 2005, Bohen served as Executive VP and COO at Rockefeller University in New York City. His career in academic administration began at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School in 1964. Public service took him to Washington, where he was on the White House domestic policy staff in the Johnson administration, and in the Carter administration at HEW and HHS. In the 1970s he twice ran as a Democratic candidate for Congress in New Jersey. Bohen resumed academic administration in the early 1980s, first at the University of Minnesota, then at Brown University, and finally at Rockefeller in 1990. Between stints in government and academia, he worked in public television and philanthropy at WNET and the Ford Foundation.

After a distinguished career in university administration and public service, Frederick Martin Bohen died peacefully at home in Manhattan on March 15, succumbing to progressive lung failure at age 77. In both his personal and professional life, he was admired for his dedication, leadership, kindness and gentlemanly qualities. Before retiring in 2005, Bohen served as Executive VP and COO at Rockefeller University in New York City. His career in academic administration began at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School in 1964. Public service took him to Washington, where he was on the White House domestic policy staff in the Johnson administration, and in the Carter administration at HEW and HHS. In the 1970s he twice ran as a Democratic candidate for Congress in New Jersey. Bohen resumed academic administration in the early 1980s, first at the University of Minnesota, then at Brown University, and finally at Rockefeller in 1990.

His immigrant grandparents were garment workers who brought their socialist ideals with them from the Old Country. His mother Ruth Lisa Schechter was a secretary who became a poet. His father, Jerry Schechter was a pattern-maker who became a sculptor. Danny attended DeWitt Clinton High School, where he served as the editor-in-chief of the legendary Clinton News.

He became a leader in the movement to end the Vietnam War, was a member of SDS and began a lifelong commitment to South Africa in 1967 as an original member of the \"London Recruits.\" He fought tirelessly against Apartheid from then on. Danny never hesitated to put his convictions on the line. In the 1970s, he turned back to his first love - journalism - and became the \"news dissector\" at radio station WBCN in Boston. He wove news and music together in collages that not only reported the day's events but also helped explain how the world worked. He was a huge influence on those who valued his independent perspective - and trusted him.

Umpqua, Oregon. Dr. Clara Johns, born July 18, 1916 on a family farm in Rockford, Illinois, died May 18, 2015 in Umpqua, Oregon. She was 98. She received her Bachelor's degree from Rockford College, and graduated from the University of Chicago as a medical doctor in 1941, one of the first three women to get medical degrees from the university. She entered the Public Health Service, and served during WWII in Washington, DC and Kansas. Later, Dr. Johns was the first woman to graduate with a Masters of Public Health from Harvard. She married Dr. William A. Hall (deceased) and raised five children. The family moved to the west coast where she pursued her career in medicine. She led a life of service and accomplishment, always aspiring to improve public health. Her interest in progressive politics informed her work to help those in need. During her career in California, she worked as a pediatrician at UCLA at the Santa Clara County Health Department with migrant populations providing preventive health and maternal and child healthcare; with the mentally ill at Agnews State Hospital; as a volunteer at the United Farmworkers clinics in Salinas; and with the Flying Samaritans treating Native Americans on remote tribal lands. She retired from her position as Medical Director of the Home Care program at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, Santa Clara, CA in 1982, where she also had served as Chief of Staff. Upon retirement she received a commendation from the State of California for her service to the community. After her retirement she enjoyed many years living among the redwoods near Watsonville, CA, and ultimately placed a conservation easement on her beloved property with the Santa Cruz Land Trust for preservation. She loved dogs and flowers, and enjoyed reading, collecting stamps, and music, remembering the songs of her childhood into old age. She spent the last 9 years of her life living with her daughter Marcia along the Umpqua River in Umpqua, OR. We will miss her sense of humor and her amazing memory for songs, poetry recitations, and all other items 'great and small' that she learned in her childhood. She is survived by daughters Diana Hall, (Tim) Mt.

He is remembered by family and friends for his kindness, generosity, humility and intellect. First and foremost, Victor was a family man, always providing loving care and encouragement. Deflecting attention from himself, he focused on others' pursuits. His introspective shyness and quiet thoughtful nature delighted in Grace's gregarious ways. A classic case of \"opposites attract\" sustained a long marriage. Known for his dry wit and cluttered desk, Victor was once asked by \"neatnik\" Grace why he never learned to \"clean up after his own mess,\" an early lesson taught to her kindergarten students. He replied, \"I never went to kindergarten.\" Last year, as Grace's progressive dementia necessitated memory care in separate quarters, Victor visited her three times daily-- his life's purpose. Born on New Year's Day, 1919 to Victor and Annie Phillips, Victor Jr. grew up fourth of six children on a farm near Waxahachie, TX. A child of the Great Depression, he learned early lessons in self- sufficiency, discipline and empathy. Childhood years spent without electricity inspired his lifelong interest in electronics. Early on, Victor built his own crystal radio set, hi-fi stereo, even a television. His gifted mind thrilled at the beauty of calculus and the power of words. He enjoyed classic literature, daily crossword puzzles and e-mailing favorite wordlists to his grandchildren. At 63, he joined the new computer revolution. Well into his 80's, he was the go-to-man for all things cyber for his children and digitally-challenged friends. Following coronary by-pass surgery at age 70, he embraced exercise. He took diurnal walks, undeterred by inclement weather. With increasing age, he switched his daily routine to a NuStep machine, pedaling until the week he died. Victor was also an early champion of psychotherapy, talking openly of its life-enhancing benefits in managing his anxiety, helping to de-stigmatize mental health care for others. An Army Veteran of World War II, Victor sustained a shrapnel injury in the Battle of the Bulge resulting in lifelong paralysis of his right arm. He talked about this significant life change in a 1997 father-son interview on Dateline NBC. In a body cast, he married Grace, June 5th, 1945. Victor attended the University of Texas, Austin, Chemical Engineering, BS, and Chemistry, MA, 1951. He was a Monsanto chemical engineer, 1950-1982. In 1965, the family moved from Texas City, TX to suburban St. Louis, where Victor was a founding member of St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Ellisville, MO. Former rector Howard Park remembers him for his unfailing humor and unwavering gratitude for the gift of divine grace. Rev. Park noted Victor's formulation of a guiding spiritual principle, \"Grace is the solution in which faith can grow.\" Victor is survived by his wife, Grace, three children, Victor D. Phillips, III, PhD of Milwaukee, WI (wife Mai), Minta Phillips, MD of Julian, NC and Stone Phillips of New York, NY, Broadcast Journalist (wife Debra), five grandchildren, Anisa Asakawa (husband Nick), Streeter, Catherine, Ben, Chiara, two cousins, five nieces and three nephews.

Umpqua, Oregon. Dr. Clara Johns, born July 18, 1916 on a family farm in Rockford, Illinois, died May 18, 2015 in Umpqua, Oregon. She was 98. She received her Bachelor's degree from Rockford College, and graduated from the University of Chicago as a medical doctor in 1941, one of the first three women to get medical degrees from the university. She entered the Public Health Service, and served during WWII in Washington, DC and Kansas. Later, Dr. Johns was the first woman to graduate with a Masters of Public Health from Harvard. She married Dr. William A. Hall (deceased) and raised five children. The family moved to the west coast where she pursued her career in medicine. She led a life of service and accomplishment, always aspiring to improve public health. Her interest in progressive politics informed her work to help those in need. During her career in California, she worked as a pediatrician at UCLA at the Santa Clara County Health Department with migrant populations providing preventive health and maternal and child healthcare; with the mentally ill at Agnews State Hospital; as a volunteer at the United Farmworkers clinics in Salinas; and with the Flying Samaritans treating Native Americans on remote tribal lands. She retired from her position as Medical Director of the Home Care program at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, Santa Clara, CA in 1982, where she also had served as Chief of Staff. Upon retirement she received a commendation from the State of California for her service to the community. After her retirement she enjoyed many years living among the redwoods near Watsonville, CA, and ultimately placed a conservation easement on her beloved property with the Santa Cruz Land Trust for preservation. She loved dogs and flowers, and enjoyed reading, collecting stamps, and music, remembering the songs of her childhood into old age. She spent the last 9 years of her life living with her daughter Marcia along the Umpqua River in Umpqua, OR. We will miss her sense of humor and her amazing memory for songs, poetry recitations, and all other items 'great and small' that she learned in her childhood. She is survived by daughters Diana Hall, (Tim) Mt.

Former president of the Century Foundation and a past chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, died on Thursday, July 16. He was 75 years old. He was being treated for Parkinson's disease and was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. Born in Webster, New York in 1940, Dick Leone spent the bulk of his career in public service. A graduate of the University of Rochester, he earned a Masters degree and a PhD at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. A pragmatic progressive whose views were forged during the Kennedy era, Leone worked on many local and national campaigns. One of his proudest moments was working as an advance man on Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign in Oregon. He also worked on presidential campaigns for George McGovern, Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis and Bill Bradley. In the '60s, he was executive director of the White House Task Force on The Cities. In addition, Leone managed Brendan Byrne's two successful campaigns for Governor of New Jersey, in 1973 and 1977. From 1974 to 1977, Leone was state treasurer of New Jersey. In 2005, he served as chairman of Governor Jon Corzine's transition committee. Leone served as a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and was chairman of the Port Authority from 1990 to 1994. From 1989 to 2011, he was president of the Century Foundation (formerly Twentieth Century Fund), a public policy think tank. Leone steered the foundation to concentrate on such issues as inequality and civil liberties and he fought against attempts at privatizing Social Security. Leone's private sector jobs included working as President of the New York Mercantile Exchange and a managing director at Dillon Read & Co. He has long been a director/trustee of multiple funds at Dreyfus Corp. and serves on the board of the Center for American Progress. Burial is private, but a memorial service will take place in Princeton, New Jersey in September. He is survived by his wife, Meg Cox Leone; his children Kate Leone and Max Leone, and his granddaughter Lucy Kirschner, as well as his sister Sandra Leone Thomas Brooks and first wife, Anita Leone. As well as many nieces, nephews and cousins. Those wishing to honor his memory can consider donations to New Jersey Policy Perspective or the Michael J.

He was 71. Since 2009, Richard fought valiantly against a debilitating and rare neurological disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). Along with his family's foundation, he spent the latter part of his life funding and actively engaging the international medical community to launch a bold research effort to combat PSP and discover a cure. His significant investment into brain research and neurodegenerative diseases has been called transformational; the goal is to find a treatment for brain-related diseases. Richard is survived by his wife Darla Moore and three children from a prior marriage, Courtney Rainwater, Todd Rainwater and Matthew Rainwater as well as Richard's brother, Walter Rainwater, sister-in-law, Lori and niece, Kelley. He also leaves behind hundreds of friends, business colleagues and people Richard mentored and launched into entrepreneurship as well as the numerous causes he funded and the countless individuals who were deeply touched by his generosity. \"A person's legacy is truly who they leave behind,\" said Darla Moore, \"and Richard populated this country with extraordinary talent that he recognized when they were very young. Not many people are generous with their time when mentoring young people. Richard was the exception.\" Richard has not made any public appearances since 2010. His son, Matthew said his father was the personification of heroism as he battled the illness. \"There is an extraordinary untold story about his heroism and bravery as the symptoms worsened. He was determined to embrace every available moment with his loved ones, and he resolved to establish a robust platform for long term research into tauopathies such as PSP and Alzheimer's Disease,\" said Matthew. \"It's another example of him actually 'willing' something into reality.\" Richard's life was undoubtedly extended because of the extraordinary care he received over the last five and a half years. The family is deeply appreciative of Stephen Boyd, Jerry Harper, Robert Patterson, Eric Thompson, Barry Less, Norman Finley, Rick Castle, Scott Rhode and Bonnie Dears. Their loving, professional and attentive care added much quality to Richard's life. Former President George W. Bush partnered with Richard and Rusty Rose in 1989 to purchase the Texas Rangers MLB club. Mr. Bush issued a statement about his friend. \"I was so saddened to learn that my friend Richard Rainwater died this weekend. Richard had a brilliant mind and a generous heart. He was a lot of fun, inspiring to be around, and generous and courageous to the very end. Laura and I send our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife, Darla, and to the children he was so proud of: Matthew, Courtney, and Todd. We also send our condolences to his loyal brother, Walter, and to Richard's family, friends, and staff who loved and cared for him.\" Those sentiments were echoed across the country from Deepdale Country Club where the flags flew at half-mast to the offices of some of the most powerful people in business to a family that Richard seeded money in order to teach a colleague's children how to give money to worthy charities. Richard's friend Ken Hersh called the loss of his friend immeasurable. \"I truly believe he was the godfather of the North American private investment business,\" Hersh told the News. He created an atmosphere and environment where accomplished, ambitious, entrepreneurial and creative people could work.\" With all of his business success, family and friends were paramount to Richard, and they describe him as playful. In fact, once he was quoted as saying, \"I don't feel like it's in anybody's interest to take themselves and life so seriously that they can't have fun.\" Richard's \"fun\" came on the golf course, and he was once a partner in the famed Pebble Beach Golf Club. He also invented a new form of friendly competitive golf for rounds with friends; the game was labeled as \"Two Ball.\" A self-described fitness fanatic, Richard, prior to the onset of his illness, was an avid marathon runner. He also loved motorsports and sponsored cars, most notably a 1957 \"muscle car,\" in competitions. Born June 15, 1944 to Walter J. Rainwater Sr. a wholesale grocer, and Regina Dieb Rainwater, a J.C. Penney sales clerk, Richard treasured his Texas roots. He grew up in his native Fort Worth, graduating from R.L. Paschal High School, and he remained a steadfast Panthers fan. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Texas and had an MBA from Stanford University. At age 26, Sid Bass, a former classmate, hired Rainwater as an investment manager for the Bass family fortune. He directed the Bass fortune of $50 million into $5 billion between 1970 and 1986. In fact, he assisted Michael Eisner when he was Disney CEO to increase his fortune into billions of dollars. In 1986, Richard started his own firm, Rainwater Inc and successfully acquired stakes in companies such as Columbia/HCA Healthcare, Ensco International, Pioneer Natural Resources, Mid Ocean Limited and Crescent Real Estate Equities. His success as an investor is legendary, prompting The New York Times to describe him this week as a \"quiet mover of wealth and power\" in the country.

Richard Edward Rainwater, philanthropist, legendary and renowned investor, father, husband, mentor, loyal friend and native Texan, passed away September 27, 2015 at his home in Fort Worth. He was 71. Since 2009, Richard fought valiantly against a debilitating and rare neurological disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). Along with his family's foundation, he spent the latter part of his life funding and actively engaging the international medical community to launch a bold research effort to combat PSP and discover a cure. His significant investment into brain research and neurodegenerative diseases has been called transformational; the goal is to find a treatment for brain-related diseases. Richard is survived by his wife Darla Moore and three children from a prior marriage, Courtney Rainwater, Todd Rainwater and his wife Lowisa; and Matthew Rainwater and his wife Jessica; as well as Richard's brother, Walter Rainwater, sister-in-law, Lori and nieces, Kelley and Kathryn. He also leaves behind hundreds of friends, business colleagues and people Richard mentored and launched into entrepreneurship as well as the numerous causes he funded and the countless individuals who were deeply touched by his generosity. \"A person's legacy is truly who they leave behind,\" said Darla Moore, \"and Richard populated this country with extraordinary talent that he recognized when they were very young. Not many people are generous with their time when mentoring young people. Richard was the exception.\" Richard has not made any public appearances since 2010. His son, Matthew said his father was the personification of heroism as he battled the illness. \"There is an extraordinary untold story about his heroism and bravery as the symptoms worsened. He was determined to embrace every available moment with his loved ones, and he resolved to establish a robust platform for long term research into tauopathies such as PSP and Alzheimer's Disease,\" said Matthew. \"It's another example of him actually 'willing' something into reality.\" Richard's life was undoubtedly extended because of the extraordinary care he received over the last five and a half years. The family is deeply appreciative of Stephen Boyd, Jerry Harper, Robert Patterson, Eric Thompson, Barry Lee, Norman Finley, Rick Castle, Scott Rhode and Bennie Dears. Their loving, professional and attentive care added much quality to Richard's life. Former President George W. Bush partnered with Richard and Rusty Rose in 1989 to purchase the Texas Rangers MLB club. Mr. Bush issued a statement about his friend. \"I was so saddened to learn that my friend Richard Rainwater died this weekend. Richard had a brilliant mind and a generous heart. He was a lot of fun, inspiring to be around, and generous and courageous to the very end. Laura and I send our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife, Darla, and to the children he was so proud of: Matthew, Courtney, and Todd. We also send our condolences to his loyal brother, Walter, and to Richard's family, friends, and staff who loved and cared for him.\" Those sentiments were echoed across the country from Deepdale Country Club where the flags flew at half-mast to the offices of some of the most powerful people in business to a family that Richard seeded money in order to teach a colleague's children how to give money to worthy charities. Richard's friend Ken Hersh called the loss of his friend immeasurable. \"I truly believe he was the godfather of the North American private investment business,\" Hersh said. He created an atmosphere and environment where accomplished, ambitious, entrepreneurial and creative people could work.\" With all of his business success, family and friends were paramount to Richard, and they describe him as playful. In fact, once he was quoted as saying, \"I don't feel like it's in anybody's interest to take themselves and life so seriously that they can't have fun.\" Richard's \"fun\" came on the golf course, and he was once a partner in the famed Pebble Beach Golf Club. He also invented a new form of friendly competitive golf for rounds with friends; the game was labeled as \"Two Ball.\" A self-described fitness fanatic, Richard, prior to the onset of his illness, was an avid marathon runner. He also loved motorsports and sponsored cars, most notably a 1957 \"muscle car,\" in competitions. Born June 15, 1944 to Walter J. Rainwater Sr. a wholesale grocer, and Regina Dieb Rainwater, a J.C. Penney sales clerk, Richard treasured his Texas roots. He grew up in his native Fort Worth, graduating from R.L. Paschal High School, and he remained a steadfast Panthers fan. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Texas and had an MBA from Stanford University. At age 26, Sid Bass, a former classmate, hired Rainwater as an investment manager for the Bass family fortune. He directed the Bass fortune of $50 million into $5 billion between 1970 and 1986. In fact, he assisted Michael Eisner when he was Disney CEO to increase his fortune into billions of dollars. In 1986, Richard started his own firm, Rainwater Inc and successfully acquired stakes in companies such as Columbia/HCA Healthcare, Ensco International, Pioneer Natural Resources, Mid Ocean Limited and Crescent Real Estate Equities. His success as an investor is legendary, prompting The New York Times to describe him this week as a \"quiet mover of wealth and power\" in the country. Services to celebrate a man whose life can be defined by its optimism, generosity, belief in his loved ones as well as his colleagues and friends will be held Friday, October 2, 2015 at Broadway Baptist Church, 305 W. Broadway Avenue, Fort Worth, Texas at 11:00am. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be offered to the Rainwater Neurological Research Fund, www.cfntx.org/rainwater. In addition, the family plans to announce details for a memorial service to be held in New York City on October 27, 2015 at Lincoln Center. 1/3","page":"19","artlID":"5615dcbd38f0d8437d65c5f3","words":"965","abstract":null,"date":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"RAINWATER, RICHARD"}],"media":[]},{"year":2015,"headline":"Kim Davis and Pope Francis&#8217;s Grand Strategy","url":"https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/kim-davis-and-pope-franciss-grand-strategy/","leadPara":null,"page":null,"artlID":"560bfd4938f0d84e279914a3","words":"703","abstract":"On the significance of a “private” encounter between the pope and the culture-war lightning rod.","date":"2015-09-30T11:17:18Z","keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"persons","value":"Francis"},{"rank":"1","name":"glocations","value":"Kentucky"},{"rank":"2","name":"glocations","value":"Rome (Italy)"},{"rank":"3","name":"glocations","value":"United States"},{"rank":"1","name":"organizations","value":"Little Sisters of the Poor"},{"rank":"2","name":"organizations","value":"Roman Catholic Church"},{"rank":"1","name":"subject","value":"Freedom of Religion"},{"rank":"2","name":"subject","value":"Same-Sex Marriage, Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships"}],"media":[]},{"year":2015,"headline":"De Blasio Returning to the National Political Stage","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/nyregion/de-blasio-returning-to-the-national-political-stage.html","leadPara":"Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, is flying to Washington &#8212; his eighth trip there as mayor &#8212; to address what is billed as &#8220;the largest-ever gathering of progressive lawmakers.&#8221;","page":"27","artlID":"560c8cbd38f0d8716779a962","words":"685","abstract":"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio returns to national political stage, encouraging support of Wisconsin Democrat Russell D Feingold's senate campaign, and sponsoring presidential forum in Iowa; planned trip to Washington, DC, will include meeting with Secretary of Housing Julian Castro, address to conference of liberal state legislators and meeting of United States Conference of Mayors, group in which de Blasio has taken active role.","date":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"Y","name":"persons","value":"de Blasio, Bill"},{"rank":"11","is_major":"N","name":"persons","value":"O'Malley, Martin J"},{"rank":"12","is_major":"N","name":"glocations","value":"Washington (DC)"},{"rank":"13","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Elections, Senate"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"Y","name":"subject","value":"United States Politics and Government"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"Y","name":"subject","value":"Mayors"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"Y","name":"persons","value":"Feingold, Russell D"},{"rank":"5","is_major":"Y","name":"glocations","value":"Wisconsin"},{"rank":"6","is_major":"Y","name":"subject","value":"Endorsements"},{"rank":"7","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Presidential Election of 2016"},{"rank":"8","is_major":"N","name":"glocations","value":"Iowa"},{"rank":"9","is_major":"N","name":"organizations","value":"Democratic Party"},{"rank":"10","is_major":"N","name":"persons","value":"Clinton, Hillary Rodham"}],"media":[{"width":190,"url":"images/2015/10/01/nyregion/BDBFORUMy/BDBFORUMy-thumbWide.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images/2015/10/01/nyregion/BDBFORUMy/BDBFORUMy-thumbWide.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images/2015/10/01/nyregion/BDBFORUMy/BDBFORUMy-articleLarge.jpg","height":401,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images/2015/10/01/nyregion/BDBFORUMy/BDBFORUMy-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"401"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images/2015/10/01/nyregion/BDBFORUMy/BDBFORUMy-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images/2015/10/01/nyregion/BDBFORUMy/BDBFORUMy-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}]},{"year":2015,"headline":"Pacific Trade Deal Talks Resume, Under Fire From U.S. Presidential Hopefuls","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/business/pacific-trade-deal-talks-resume-under-fire-from-us-presidential-hopefuls.html","leadPara":"The proposed agreement, which would be a legacy achievement for President Obama, has had trade ministers deadlocked over pharmaceutical drug protections, auto exports and other matters.","page":"3","artlID":"560c8d9a38f0d8716779a966","words":"1131","abstract":"Officials from United States and 11 Pacific nations resume trade deal negotiations; significant differences between participants persist, and prospects have also been harmed by slew of criticism from American presidential candidates.
