                            <p> 
                                There have been many recent initiatives spearheading the digitization of art. Large-scale, innovative projects, like <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/">Google’s Arts & Culture</a>, originally inspired us to look into this domain. A few high profile museums are making all, or a portion, of their collections available to the public online. We were drawn to Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum because of its <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/api">newly released and comprehensive API</a>.<br><br>

                                We were also impressed by <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-nerds-guide-to-the-2229-paintings-at-moma/">creative art dimensions visualizations completed with the MoMA's API</a> and <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.ifweassume.com/2013/11/the-dimensions-of-art.html">Tate Modern’s API</a>, and <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="http://visualoop.com/blog/83181/portfolio-of-the-week-gabriel-gianordoli">color visualizations</a> (left). Furthermore, projects like <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.nextrembrandt.com/">The Next Rembrandt</a> and <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://localprojects.net/work/cleveland-museum-of-art-gallery-one">Local Projects' museum installation</a> inspired us to incorporate facial recognition.

                            <p>
                                As the Rijksmuseum's collection is so vast, it took us a while to get acquainted with all that we had access to and narrow in on interesting portions of the data. We created an interface to quickly filter and explore the art. Eventually, we decided to focus on paintings. Not only were we most interested in paintings, but in some cases, working with the other art forms (e.g. statues) caused headaches. For example, as the API provided a rectangular image of each piece, our algorithms would inaccurately treat the white-wall background of a statue as art, too, causing the dimensions and colors to be useless.

                            <p>
                                We were interested in presenting each painting as a strip of its colors because the artists of The Hague School allegedly had palettes that transitioned from gloomy and gray to lighter and brighter, under the influence of French Impressionism. (However, our visualization did not support this claim.) To accomplish this, we went through every image of every painting in The Hague School and pulled 600 pixels from it. We ensured that the pixels would be a sampling of colors that accurately summarized the painting by selecting evenly-spaced pixels: each x and y position of a pixel had the same ratio as the width and height of the painting, and they stretched across the entire image.

                            <p>
                                Next, we wanted to sort the pixel colors to make them more easily comparable. As color can be sorted primarily across 3 dimensions (hue, saturation, and value), it proved to be difficult to get a smooth sort in a linear, 2 dimensional representation. We experimented with many strategies, for example sorting by saturation and then subsorting by hue, but this created unattractive bands. In the end, sorting by hue was the most effective option. It was fun to sort filtered portions of the collection; pictured to the left, strips of colors from Rembrandt are sorted vertically.

                                We struggled to find a facial recognition API that was effective with paintings as their algorithms are trained on photographs of people. Finally, we deemed the best to be Kairos, as it accurately located the majority of the faces in the paintings.

                            <p>
                                Once we were able to access and organize the data, we brainstormed together how to best represent it. We considered timelines, filters, sorting, small multiples, and more (left). We gave form to our rough ideas by drawing on paper and whiteboards. We iterated and revised based on suggestions from one another. After generating many concepts, we were all attached to 4. We decided to try and implement all 4, but prioritized them, actually finishing the last concept after we had already handed-in our final project!<br><br> 

                                Our first priority was to create a visualization that would serve as an overview of the ~4,000 paintings. We also wanted it to be immediately clear that visiting the museum’s exhibits only scratches the surface of the impressive collection. (While familiarizing ourselves with the data, we were astonished by how much of the artwork sits in storage. <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://qz.com/583354/why-is-so-much-of-the-worlds-great-art-in-storage/">This is typical of museums</a>.) Revealing stored art provides an exciting opportunity because it is one of the few clear advantages technology has over an in-person museum experience. On our site, this piece is called, "<a class="underline" target="_blank" href="http://rijksviz.com/museum/iceberg.html">Beyond the Exhibits</a>."

                                We incorporated the colored pixels into 2 visualizations because of their beauty. We thought the elegant color arrays would pair nicely with our goal to simultaneously showcase the museum’s renowned surroundings: the intricate streets and canals of Amsterdam. We set <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="http://rijksviz.com/museum/masterpieces.html">colored pixels from various masterpieces to gracefully flow along the canals of an Amsterdam map, gradually aggregating on a blank canvas</a> and fading to reveal the full painting image.<br><br>

                                For dimensions, we ended up <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="http://rijksviz.com/museum/hague.html">stacking all of the canvas outlines on top of one another with their bottom left corners aligned</a>, although we also considered aligning them by their centers. We found the former to be more effective when making comparisons, though. We found that our visualizations quickly became complex with so much information, so we incorporated interactivity to empower users to make sense of the visualization by moving around the page.

                                We decided to playfully bring the faces in the paintings to life by giving each of the <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="http://rijksviz.com/museum/facesRijks.html">“individuals” (faces) a social media page</a>, where we listed their “personal information” such as birthday, nationality, and skin texture!
