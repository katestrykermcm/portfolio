                    <h6>A Typical Project</h6>
                    <p>
                        For each project, I would meet with the specialized team of experts to be briefed on the case and their efforts. Once I had a <span>deep understanding of the investigation</span> and the story that the data illuminated, I would move forward with sketching and mocking up visualization options. The creation process was typically <span>extremely iterative</span>; I would constantly interface with the specialized experts to update and improve my work based on their findings, while getting their feedback to <span>ensure clarity and accuracy</span>. 

                        <br><br>Unfortunately for this section of my portfolio, nearly all of the work I completed at Stroz Friedberg for the Digital Forensics, Incident Response, and Security Science teams was <span>strictly confidential</span>. Therefore, I have <span>almost no process work to share</span> other than a few iterations of a recruiting project I completed for the Marketing team. This project adhered to the geometric Stroz Friedberg brand and the college campus recruiters' playful theme of a journey through their newest entry-level program. They were drawn to elements inspired by "The Game of Life" and early computer games.

                    <p>
                        Put simply, Stroz Friedberg helped their clients understand how attacks on their networks occurred (Digital Forensics), how to immediately respond as an attack was happening (Incident Response), and how to better protect themselves against future attacks (Security Science). <span>I worked closely with experts on these different teams to understand the problems our clients faced. Then, I equipped the experts with intuitive, accurate, and concise representations to present their findings and recommendations to clients, who often did not have technical backgrounds.</span> Although I completed over 50 information graphics and data visualizations over the course of my time at Stroz Friedberg, I only have access to this small subset of highly sanitized work because nearly every project was strictly confidential.

                        An attacker infected Company ABC’s machines with malware. This attack timeline provides a comprehensive list of the targeted machines. <span>Lines extend from the date that the malware was installed, to the date that it was eliminated.</span> All malware lines end when the Incident Response teams took action in early November.

                    <p>
                        An attacker successfully gained access to Company ABC's employees’ OWA’s (Outlook Web Access) accounts, VPN’s, and direct deposit accounts. They realized they had been targeted only after <span>the attacker wired money from these company accounts to his own account</span>. To determine how exactly this huge loss transpired, Company ABC sought the expertise of the Digital Forensic team. This information graphic was used to summarize the examiners' findings by <span>explaining the typical stages of a phishing attack and highlighting how deeply each of the involved employees entered into each stage</span>. Employee O.G. was the first to be phished; once his account was compromised, the attacker was able to use his email to initiate a spear-phishing attack on a slew of O.G.'s coworkers. A small subset of these coworkers were eventually hoodwinked into wiring the money.

This infographic depicts the findings of the Digital Forensics team of examiners: <span>a series of events over a 12 hour period confirm that a wiping tool was used to eliminate data on both of the suspects' machines.</span>

                        This graphic complemented a report chronicling Company ABC’s phone call recording practices over a 5 year period. <span>It's purpose was to quickly convey the dates and locations lacking adequate coverage. Additionally, it reveals time periods when management prioritized reviewing their practices</span>, by identifying dates when they accessed the back-ups. The infographic illustrates the number of calls recorded at each office location and the dates through which Company ABC was (i.) recording the phone calls as WAV files, (ii.) backing-up the WAV files to DVD, (iii.) accessing the primary WAV files, and (iv.) accessing the DVD backups.
